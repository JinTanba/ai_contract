The reasoningHub makes it possible to prove the connection between the results of LLM reasoning and the process (prompt and code) through smart contracts and chainlinkFunction, providing reasoning application developers with a way to describe reasoning that is transparent and traceable, For contract developers, it additionally provides an easy way to describe llm reasoning in protocols and Dapps.
